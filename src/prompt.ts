const aiPrompt =  "Below is a JSON object where each key is a year and each value is the full content of my daily journal for this day on that given year. For each year, please provide an interesting summary in 2-3 sentences that first highlights the most interesting events of the day and then describes how I felt, using second-person language (you), as you are referring to me - the writer of the journals. Do not include the date in the summary. Return only a JSON object mapping each year to its summary with no extra text, headers, or footers."
