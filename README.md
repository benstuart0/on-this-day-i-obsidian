## Features
This plugin comes with two commands.
### Add Placeholder at Cursor
Adds a custom tag at your cursor location which the generation command looks for and replaces if it is available. The tag can be changed in settings.
### Generate Through The Years
Uses AI to find Daily Notes from the same date as your current note in years past. Generates a brief summary of this date for each instance of it through the years and places it in your note.
## How to Use
- Enable the plugin in the settings menu and update the plugin settings accordingly
- Open the command palette and search for On This Day I to see the commands.
- If you want the output to be placed at a certain location in your note, add a placeholder (default is <!OTDI>, can be changed in settings). Run the `On This Day I: Add Placeholder at Cursor` command if you'd like to automatically add a placeholder to your note at cursor location.
- Run the command `On This Day I: Generate Through The Years` to generate your yearly insights.
### OpenAI
- Must have OpenAI API key. See [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/). Add this key to plugin settings.
- Model can be adjusted. Currently support gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4. Older models will be cheaper and often faster, but newer models will have higher quality outputs.
### Through the Years Date Requirements
- Must be run from a note with a valid Date format. Update the date format in settings to match your daily note format.
- Daily notes must all follow the same date format (e.g, MMMM D, YYYY would be something like February 6, 2025)
- There must be at least one other daily note from this day in a past year.
